title: About me
subtitle: Data Scientist | Statistician | Researcher
---

Hi! My name is Zhiyu Guo, though I also go by Jessica. I'm a data scientist and statistician with a strong background in causal inference, fairness analysis, and natural language processing.

## Background

I completed doctoral coursework (Aug 2021 - Aug 2025) in the joint program between Statistics & Data Science and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, earning an M.Phil. in Public Policy and Management (Aug 2025) and M.S. in Statistics (May 2023). During my time at CMU, I worked with advisors Edward H. Kennedy and Eli Ben-Michael on research at the intersection of causal inference, algorithmic fairness, and text analysis.

Before CMU, I graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics (cum laude) in May 2021, with minors in Business Studies and Social and Cultural Analysis.

## Research & Professional Experience

My research focuses on developing and applying rigorous statistical methods to address critical questions about fairness and disparities:

- **Criminal Justice**: Analyzed racial disparities in jury selection using doubly robust causal inference on 2,300 jurors across 89 trials
- **Algorithmic Fairness**: Evaluated fairness and effectiveness of the Allegheny Housing Assessment algorithm using 25,000 records
- **Gender Disparities**: Assessed gender disparities in social media engagement using 97,000 Reddit posts with advanced text matching methods
- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: Built Bayesian predictive models for drug pipeline optimization at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals

I've presented my research at major conferences, including the Joint Statistical Meetings (2025), American Causal Inference Conference (2023), and IEEE ProComm (2023), and published in peer-reviewed journals.

## Teaching Experience

I served as a Teaching Assistant for 8+ courses at CMU, mentoring over 200 students in:
- Management Science I/II (Spring 2024, Spring 2025)
- Special Topics: Text Analysis (Fall 2022, Fall 2023, Fall 2024)
- Reasoning with Data (Summer 2022)
- Introduction to Probability Theory (Fall 2021)

I also developed statistical computing materials and data analysis examples that are publicly available for educational use.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on:
- **Causal Inference**: Developing and applying methods to estimate causal effects from observational data
- **Algorithmic Fairness**: Analyzing and addressing disparities in machine learning systems and automated decision-making
- **Text Analysis & NLP**: Applying statistical methods to understand patterns in textual data, including gender disparities in online discourse
- **Applied Statistics**: Using statistical techniques to solve real-world problems in policy and technology

## What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking opportunities in data science, data analytics, and research roles where I can apply my statistical expertise to solve meaningful problems. I'm particularly interested in:
- Organizations working on social impact and policy issues
- Teams developing fair and ethical AI/ML systems  
- Research-oriented roles in tech or consulting
- Positions that value rigorous statistical thinking and clear communication
