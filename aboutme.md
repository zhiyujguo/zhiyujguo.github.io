Hi! My name is Zhiyu Guo but I also go by Jessica. I'm currently a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the joint program between Statistics and Public Policy. My research interest includes causal inference, fairness/disparities problems, and text analysis/NLP. 

Before coming to Pittsburgh, I graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics in 2021.
