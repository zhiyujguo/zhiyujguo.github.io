subtitle: Data Scientist | Statistician | Researcher
---

Hi! My name is Zhiyu Guo, though I also go by Jessica. I'm a data scientist and statistician specializing in causal inference, fairness analysis, and text analysis.

## Background

I completed doctoral coursework in Statistics & Data Science and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (2021-2025), earning an M.Phil. in Public Policy and Management and M.S. in Statistics. I also hold a B.A. in Mathematics (cum laude) from New York University (2021).

## Research & Professional Experience

My work focuses on applying rigorous statistical methods to address fairness and disparities:

- **Criminal Justice**: Analyzed racial disparities in jury selection using doubly robust causal inference (JSM 2025)
- **Algorithmic Fairness**: Evaluated housing assessment algorithms for effectiveness and equity
- **Text Analysis**: Assessed gender disparities in social media using advanced matching methods on 97K posts (ACIC 2023)
- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: Built Bayesian predictive models for drug pipeline optimization at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals

I've published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at major statistical conferences, and taught 200+ graduate students as a TA for 8+ courses at CMU.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking data science, data analytics, or research positions where I can apply statistical rigor to solve meaningful problems. I'm particularly interested in:

- Organizations working on social impact, policy, or fairness issues
- Teams developing ethical AI/ML systems
- Research-oriented roles in tech, consulting, or policy
- Positions valuing statistical thinking and clear communication

## Skills & Expertise

**Methods**: Causal inference, machine learning, survival analysis, text/NLP, Bayesian methods, sensitivity analysis, program evaluation

**Programming**: R, Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, MATLAB, Git, Tableau

**Domain**: Algorithmic fairness, criminal justice statistics, pharmaceutical analytics, social media analysis, large-scale data processing

**Communication**: Technical writing, executive presentations, teaching, translating complex findings for diverse audiences
